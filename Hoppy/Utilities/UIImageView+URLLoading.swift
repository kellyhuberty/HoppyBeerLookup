/**
 This extension is used to retrieve data off of the network and create a UIImage to use for the UIImageView's view.
 
 Note: This is a extension I originally wrote in objective-c many years ago and have re-written very similarly many different ways.
 I've also seen different implementations of this with the same basic premise. I decided now was a good time to re-write this
 in swift.
 
 Because I wanted to re-use this again I decided to forego using Alamofire to not create a dependence on it.
